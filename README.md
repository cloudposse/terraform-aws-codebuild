[![Terraform Open Source Modules](https://docs.cloudposse.com/images/terraform-open-source-modules.svg)][terraform_modules]



It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 







## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-codebuild/releases).


Include this module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "build" {
    source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-codebuild.git?ref=master"
    namespace           = "eg"
    stage               = "staging"
    name                = "app"

    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html
    build_image         = "aws/codebuild/standard:2.0"
    build_compute_type  = "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"
    build_timeout       = 60

    # These attributes are optional, used as ENV variables when building Docker images and pushing them to ECR
    # For more info:
    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-docker.html
    # https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/codebuild_project.html

    privileged_mode     = true
    aws_region          = "us-east-1"
    aws_account_id      = "xxxxxxxxxx"
    image_repo_name     = "ecr-repo-name"
    image_tag           = "latest"

    # Optional extra environment variables
    environment_variables = [{
        name  = "JENKINS_URL"
        value = "https://jenkins.example.com"
      },
      {
        name  = "COMPANY_NAME"
        value = "Amazon"
      },
      {
        name = "TIME_ZONE"
        value = "Pacific/Auckland"

      }]
}
```
