Terraform module to create AWS CodeBuild project for AWS CodePipeline.


---

This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).










## Usage

Include this module in your existing terraform code:

```hcl
module "build" {
    source              = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-codebuild.git?ref=master"
    namespace           = "general"
    name                = "ci"
    stage               = "staging"

    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html
    build_image         = "aws/codebuild/docker:1.12.1"
    build_compute_type  = "BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL"

    # These attributes are optional, used as ENV variables when building Docker images and pushing them to ECR
    # For more info:
    # http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/sample-docker.html
    # https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/r/codebuild_project.html

    privileged_mode     = "true"
    aws_region          = "us-east-1"
    aws_account_id      = "xxxxxxxxxx"
    image_repo_name     = "ecr-repo-name"
    image_tag           = "latest"

    # Optional extra environment variables
    environment_variables = [{
        name  = "JENKINS_URL"
        value = "https://jenkins.example.com"
      },
      {
        name  = "COMPANY_NAME"
        value = "Amazon"
      },
      {
        name = "TIME_ZONE"
        value = "Pacific/Auckland"

      }]
}
```

### To hide warnings about unset versions in providers

Add this to your .tf files
```hcl
provider "random" {
  version = "~> 1.0"
}

provider "null" {
  version = "~> 1.0"
}
```
